# Animhouse_dsaproject

The Virtual Animhouse is a portal designed to enter
the animal records in a secured virtual place where
they are being taken care of by a master, where a
master adds the animals , keeping record of their age
and assigning them a IC number. This is designed
using concepts of c++ stacks and the linked list . This
system is based on the client's information idea. The
customer can perform all errands here such as
adding the animal data, retrieving their information
once needed even in a sorted form and obviously , if

you changed your mind to add the animal in your
virtual animhouse, you can remove that animal.
An animal house can be defined as an area in which
the birds and animals are protected and are kept
safely in their natural habitats , providing them a
safe living and protecting them from the illegal
activities like poaching and trafficking. So keeping in
mind the importance of such initiatives , we came up
with an idea of designing a virtual Animhouse, that is
a portal to store the animal data in a proper manner
so that other functionalities could be added in the
future so that our initiative could reach its best
potential. The Animal houses could be important for
studies and research purposes so as to provide the
animals with the best care. The main objective of the
virtual animal house is to build an organic and
optimal system of interaction for adding the animal
data keeping record and retrieving them for further
study and functionalities.
